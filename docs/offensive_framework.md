# G3r4ki Offensive Framework â€” Elite Module System

## Overview

The G3r4ki Offensive Framework Elite Module System is a comprehensive, modular architecture that enhances G3r4ki's offensive security capabilities. These modules provide advanced penetration testing and red team operation tools, designed with a focus on automation, stealth, and operational efficiency.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each capability is a self-contained module that can be loaded independently.
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Modules are loaded based on operational needs and available system resources.
3. **Mission-Oriented Chaining**: G3r4ki intelligently selects and chains modules based on mission parameters (Stealth, Loud, Persistence, Data Extraction).
4. **Minimal Footprint**: Modules are designed to minimize their footprint on target systems.
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support for Linux, Windows, and macOS targets.
6. **Offline Operation**: All modules are capable of operating without cloud dependencies.
