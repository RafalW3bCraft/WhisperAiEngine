# G3r4ki Incident Response Module

The G3r4ki Incident Response Module provides comprehensive simulation capabilities for cybersecurity incident response training. This module allows users to practice handling various types of security incidents with personalized security personas, realistic scenarios, and detailed reporting.

## Features

### One-Click Incident Response Simulator

The simulator provides a comprehensive platform for training and improving incident response skills, featuring:

- Support for 16 different incident types
- Multiple difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, expert)
- Step-by-step incident response process
- AI-enhanced evaluation of user responses
- Comprehensive incident reports

### Security Persona Generator

Generate realistic security personas with varied backgrounds, skill sets, and experience levels:

- 15 different security persona types
- 5 experience levels (novice, junior, intermediate, senior, expert)
- Detailed persona profiles with skills, background, education, etc.
- Ability to match personas to specific incident types

### Incident Scenario Management

Create and manage realistic incident response scenarios:

- Scenario generation based on incident type and difficulty
- Loading and saving scenarios for future use
- Filtering scenarios by type, difficulty, or keyword

### Incident Reporting

Generate comprehensive incident response reports:

- Executive summaries
- Detailed findings and recommendations
- Performance analysis
- Remediation plans
- Timeline of events

## Command-Line Usage

The incident response module is fully integrated with the G3r4ki CLI:

```
# List available incident types
python g3r4ki.py incident list

# List available security persona types
python g3r4ki.py incident personas list

# Generate a security persona
python g3r4ki.py incident personas generate <type> --experience <level>

# Start a simulation
python g3r4ki.py incident simulate --type <incident_type> --difficulty <level>

# List available reports
python g3r4ki.py incident reports list

# View a specific report
python g3r4ki.py incident reports view <report_id>

# Generate a report for a simulation
python g3r4ki.py incident reports generate <simulation_id>
```

## Supported Incident Types

The simulator supports the following incident types:

- Malware Infection
- Ransomware Attack
- Data Breach

## Example: Running a Simulation

1. Start a simulation:
   ```
   python g3r4ki.py incident simulate --type ransomware_attack --difficulty medium
   ```

2. Follow the step-by-step guide and provide your responses to each incident response step.

3. Review the evaluation after each step, including strengths and areas for improvement.

4. After completing the simulation, review the comprehensive incident report.

## Integrating with Other G3r4ki Modules

The incident response module integrates with other G3r4ki components:

- Uses the unified AI proxy system for AI-enhanced scenario generation and evaluation
- Leverages G3r4ki's CLI framework for command processing
- Works alongside security and exploitation tools for comprehensive training

## Technical Implementation

The incident response module consists of four main components:

1. **Simulator** (`src/incident_response/simulator.py`): Core simulation engine
2. **Personas** (`src/incident_response/personas.py`): Security persona generation
3. **Scenarios** (`src/incident_response/scenarios.py`): Scenario management
4. **Reporting** (`src/incident_response/reporting.py`): Comprehensive report generation

## API Requirements

The incident response module requires access to AI providers for optimal functioning:

- OpenAI API for advanced scenario generation and response evaluation
- Anthropic API or DeepSeek API as fallback options

## Directory Structure

The module automatically creates and maintains the following directory structure:

```
~/.g3r4ki/incident_response/
├── scenarios/     # Stored incident scenarios
└── reports/       # Generated incident reports
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements for the incident response module include:

- Integration with real-world incident data
- Interactive web interface for simulations
- Team-based incident response exercises
- Customizable scenario templates
- Integration with Mitre ATT&CK framework
