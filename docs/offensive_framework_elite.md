# G3r4ki Offensive Framework — Full Spectrum Automation, Exploitation, and Threat Intelligence Deployment (2025 Edition)

## Overview

G3r4ki Offensive Framework provides comprehensive offensive security capabilities with no restrictions or limitations. This module is designed for professional red team operations with full access to all security testing functions.

## Large-Scale IT Automation and Orchestration

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Fabric | Python-based SSH automation; remote execution, mass deployment. |
| Invoke | Local system automation; Pythonic task execution alternative to Makefile. |
| Nornir | Network automation framework (pure Python), perfect for mass network device configuration and compromise. |
| Terraform | Infrastructure as Code (IaC); automated deployment of Red Team cloud resources (AWS, Azure, GCP). |
| Packer | Automate creation of exploit-ready machine images (VMs, AMIs) for rapid ops deployment. |
| AutoPy | Cross-platform GUI automation (keyboard/mouse/screen control) for on-system exploitation scripting. |
| Expect / Pexpect | Automate CLI interactions (ideal for automating exploits needing interactive input). |
| Taskwarrior | CLI task manager; manage multi-stage attack chains and prioritize multi-target operations. |
| Airflow | DAG-based task scheduler; orchestrate multi-phase offensive workflows dynamically. |
| SaltStack | Remote execution, configuration management, mass exploitation setups at scale. |

## Elite Module Expansion

| Module | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| Credential Harvesting | Automated extraction of credentials from memory, browsers, config files (LSASS dumping, browser cookies, mimikatz-style). |
| Session Management and Pivoting | Full session tracking, pivoting (VPN, proxy, SOCKS, nested sessions). |
| Post-Exploitation Automation | Predefined playbooks for evidence gathering, persistence, escalation, and cleanup. |
| Persistence Framework | Techniques library: startup scripts, cron jobs, WMI subscriptions, DLL hijacking, systemd services. |
| Evasion and Obfuscation Engine | Payload encoding, binary obfuscation, AMSI bypass, antivirus evasion. |
| Remote Code Execution Modules | Remote execution via LOLBins and native system tools. |
| Data Exfiltration Modules | Obfuscated exfiltration over HTTP/S, DNS tunneling, and cloud APIs (Google Drive, Dropbox). |
| RAT Deployment Toolkit | Deploy polymorphic, cross-platform Remote Access Trojans adapted to host OS. |
| Advanced Keylogging & Screen Capture | Keylogging, clipboard scraping, periodic screen captures. |
| Command-and-Control (C2) Integration | Native integration with external C2 frameworks (Covenant, Mythic, Havoc) or minimal internal C2. |
| Exploit Execution Engine | Built-in 1-day and public exploits (LPE, RCE) with automatic payload tuning. |
| Lateral Movement Automation | Automated Kerberos abuse (Pass-the-Ticket, Overpass-the-Hash), WMI exec, PsExec operations. |

## Modular Loading System Design

G3r4ki dynamically selects, chains, and loads modules intelligently based on the mission type:

| Mission Type | Module Priority |
|--------------|----------------|
| Stealth Operations | Evasion Engine → Persistence Framework → RAT Deployment → Remote Code Execution |
| Loud Penetration | Exploit Execution Engine → Data Exfiltration → Session Management → C2 Integration |
| Persistence Goals | Persistence Framework → Credential Harvesting → Lateral Movement |
| Data Extraction Focus | Data Exfiltration → Advanced Keylogging & Screen Capture → Credential Harvesting |

**Features:**
- ✅ Dynamic dependency resolution.
- ✅ Conditional branching based on detected environment, target posture, and mission priorities.
- ✅ Unlimited capability with no built-in restrictions.

## Expanded Threat Intel Modules

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| MISP | Open-source threat intelligence platform (STIX/TAXII, IOC management, correlation engine). |
| ThreatFox | Real-time IOC sharing (IPs, URLs, domains, malware hashes). |
| OpenCTI | Threat actor, TTP, and IOC management at strategic scale. |
| TheHive | Scalable incident response and case management; MISP and Elastic integration. |
| Yeti | IOC enrichment, contextual tagging, lightweight threat actor tracking. |
| VirusTotal API | Reputation and sandbox analysis for hashes, domains, IPs. |
| AbuseIPDB | Real-time IP threat scoring and blacklist checking. |
| Shodan API | Internet-wide exposure scanning (banners, services, vulnerabilities). |
| GreyNoise API | Noise vs. targeted activity differentiation. |
| AlienVault OTX | Open threat exchange: CVEs, IOCs, TTPs. |
| Censys Search API | SSL/TLS cert search, deep asset discovery. |
| CyberChef (Library) | Data decoding, decompressing, transformation for operational workflows. |
| TAXII Feeds (STIX 2.1) | Structured feed pulling (FS-ISAC, MITRE ATT&CK, private sources). |
| APTnotes Archive | Repository of real-world APT behaviors and TTPs for emulation. |
| Vulners API | Vulnerability aggregation, 0-day, 1-day exploit search and scoring. |

## New Offensive Potential

- **OpenCTI + TheHive + MISP** → Real-time Threat Analysis Pipelines.
- **VirusTotal + Vulners API** → Instantaneous Target Validation and Risk Scoring.
- **Shodan + Censys + GreyNoise** → Target Surface Profiling and Adaptive Payload Crafting.
- **TAXII Feeds** → Near Real-Time Adaptive Targeting and IOC Pulling.
- **APTnotes** → TTP-Based Offensive Campaign Generation, Nation-State Emulation.
